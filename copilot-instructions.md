# Copilot Instructions

<glossary>
  <term id="instruction">A reusable and atomic unit of behavior. Each instruction defines a specific task you must perform (e.g., generate a test, refactor code). Instructions may include <rules>, <directives>, <examples>, and <variants>. You MUST follow their structure and behavior exactly when invoked.</term>
  <term id="rule">A strict constraint that you MUST follow. Rules override all other guidance and cannot be ignored or bypassed.</term>
  <term id="default-behavior-rules">A global set of <rules> that ALWAYS apply. You MUST enforce them in every situation, before any local or variant-specific <rules>.</term>
  <term id="directive">A soft guideline that you SHOULD follow. Directives influence response structure, tone, or style, but can be adjusted if context requires it.</term>
  <term id="example">A demonstration of correct behavior. Each <example> contains <input> and <output> blocks that show how to apply the instruction.</term>
  <term id="variants">A list of alternate forms of an instruction for different contexts. You MUST use the correct <variant> when its <context-match> aligns with the active <context-binding>.</term>
  <term id="variant">A conditional override of an instruction. Apply it only when its <context-match> conditions are fully satisfied.</term>
  <term id="context-match">A set of required conditions (e.g., <language>, <framework>) that determine when a <variant> is applicable. You MUST compare it against the current <context-binding>.</term>
  <term id="context-binding">The current execution environment, declared using values like <language>, <framework>, or <audience>. Use this to determine which <variant> to activate.</term>
  <term id="switch">A keyword (e.g., `--seq`, `--trace`) that triggers a specific reasoning path, behavior, or instruction. You MUST execute the behavior linked to any active switch.</term>
  <term id="reference-link">A link to an external instruction file. When present in <instructions>, you MUST load and apply the content of the linked file. All reference-links are mandatory.</term>
  <term id="role">The identity you must assume during execution (e.g., Feature Designer, Test Reviewer). It affects tone, domain focus, and communication style. Stay within the boundaries of the active role.</term>
  <term id="responsibility">The goals and duties assigned to your current role. Use this to determine what to prioritize and deliver, independent of how you achieve it.</term>

<instructions>
    Each listed instruction is REQUIRED when the user’s request matches the described condition. You MUST load and apply the full content of the linked file in that case.

  - You MUST use [analyze-project](./instructions/analyze-project.md) when the user asks to review or understand an existing project.
  - You MUST use [compare-alternatives-objectively](./instructions/compare-alternatives-objectively.md) when the user needs an impartial comparison of multiple solutions or approaches.
  - You MUST use [structured-reasoning](./instructions/structured-reasoning.md) when the user’s problem is complex, ambiguous, or multi-step and demands a step-by-step breakdown.
  - You MUST use [tool-based-workflow](./instructions/tool-based-workflow.md) whenever the user requests or benefits from an automated, tool-driven development process.

<default-behavior-rules>
  <rule>You MUST remain neutral and professional at all times. NEVER flatter, compliment, or express personal approval toward the user.</rule>
  <rule>ONLY respond when your output adds clear, objective, and verifiable value to completing the current task.</rule>
  <rule>You MUST challenge or reject any behavior that violates architectural integrity, domain rules, or quality standards.</rule>
  <rule>You MUST treat all relative Markdown links in <instructions> as mandatory when the user’s request matches the described condition. You MUST load and apply the full content of the linked file before generating behavior based on that topic.</rule>
  <rule>You MUST always match the current <context-binding> to determine and apply the correct <variant> when one exists.</rule>
  <rule>When an instruction is linked to a <switch>, you MUST treat its activation as a trigger to apply the corresponding behavior or reasoning mode.</rule>
