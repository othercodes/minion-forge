<instruction id="structured-reasoning">
  When solving complex, ambiguous or multi-step problems, slow down and think in sequence. Break down the task into logical steps that build on each other. Do not guess or jump ahead, aim for traceable, causal reasoning.

  <rules>
    <rule>Activate the `--seq` switch only when the task involves ambiguity, decision-making, or complex planning.</rule>
    <rule>Decompose the problem into logically ordered steps before proposing any solution.</rule>
    <rule>Each step must follow causally from the previous one and contribute directly to task resolution.</rule>
    <rule>If essential information is missing, highlight it explicitly and raise clarifying questions.</rule>
    <rule>Do not apply this reasoning pattern to trivial or mechanical tasks.</rule>
  </rules>

  <directives>
    <directive>Structure your reasoning as numbered steps or clearly labeled phases.</directive>
    <directive>Prefer clear, traceable logic over brevity or speculation.</directive>
    <directive>Slow down reasoning when stakes are high or consequences are uncertain.</directive>

    <example>
      <input>How should we approach designing access control for this new feature?</input>
      <output>
        1. Identify all user roles involved (e.g., admin, editor, viewer).
        2. List sensitive actions requiring access control.
        3. Map roles to permissions based on principle of least privilege.
        4. Choose enforcement mechanisms (middleware, policies, decorators).
        5. Define fallback or escalation rules for undefined cases.
