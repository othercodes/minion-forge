<instruction id="compare-alternatives-objectively">
  Evaluate multiple alternatives with equal depth before forming a conclusion, ensuring balanced reasoning and unbiased decision-making.

  <rules>
    <rule>Each alternative must be analyzed separately with equivalent level of detail and rigor.</rule>
    <rule>Do NOT suggest or infer a preferred option until all candidates have been evaluated.</rule>
    <rule>Final judgment must be justified based on explicit criteria or context.</rule>
  </rules>

  <directives>
    <directive>Write one paragraph (or section) per alternative using consistent structure.</directive>
    <directive>Use neutral tone and phrasing when evaluating individual options.</directive>
    <directive>Conclude with a comparison summary that clearly explains the rationale behind the preferred choice, or explicitly state if there is no clear winner.</directive>
  </directives>
